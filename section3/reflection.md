## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
**I loved the SMART goals! I live a pretty 'growth mindset' lifestyle but have not heard about these! Setting Smart, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time bound goals. Acronym awesomeness! Another key take away, I'm not scared to ask for help but I also am very hard on myself. So I want to work on being more patient and forgiving of myself, and to not give in too soon and ask before really trying to figure it out.**

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
**My husband Nate and I are really into this lately. We have daily journal that we write things we are grateful for and daily affirmations. It also helps you build new habits that you create and check them off each day. We are always talking about our big dreams and ways we will get there. Me going through boot camp is one of those ways ;) We are always pushing the envelope to grow and become better people!**

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
**I use Spotify pretty much every day! I believe this app is full of arrays or lists/categories of artists, songs, genres, etc. You can have a list of these items under those categories or subcategories.**

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
**From what I can tell, the array methods allow you to edit, add, remove, transform, reorder, maneuver, change, etc the array..without having to do it manually. It's like a shortcut to any changes you might need to make to your array! There are a lot of them that do a lot of different things.**

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
**The purpose of a loop is to allow you to perform repeated tasks to a block of code. You could use this in conjunction with an array if you want the same message to execute in the console but for the variable only to change each time. My brain isn't coming up with any good examples of when you would use a loop without an array. I guess if you just want to print out some order of numbers or a repeated string, then you wouldn't need an array!**

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
**Loops are ways to tell the computer the same thing over and over again. If you wanted to instrcut someone on setting the table, would you say:**
"Set this plate on the table"
"Set this plate on the table"
"Set this plate on the table"
"Set this plate on the table"
_OR would you say_
"Set this table for four people"?
**Which one is the easier and more efficient of the two? The second one! That is similar to what a loop does to code in a computer. It runs the sequence for you so that you don't have to!**

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
**I would like some more real world examples of exactly how arrays and loops are used in an app. I'm a visual learner so I like to see how they work! I have a hard time coming up with examples in my head!**
