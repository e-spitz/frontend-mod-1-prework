**Methods**

_pop_: This method basically takes the last element from the array, removes it, and returns it in the output. It changes the length of the array since it removes the last element.

_push_: This method allows you to add one or more elements to an array and then will return the new length of the array. The elements are added to the end of the array.

_shift_: This is similar to the pop method, but instead of removing and returning the last element of the array, it removes and returns the first element of the array. It also changes the length of the array.

_unshift_: This is similar to the push method, but instead allows you to add one or more elements to the beginning of the array, and will then return the new length of the array.
