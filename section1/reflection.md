## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* **I really liked this article! Honestly, it is a little scary to me, because I have never been much a reader. I don't read for enjoyment, I like to do hands on things instead! But it totally makes sense as to why reading helps with success. You are constantly pushing the boundaries of your mind and creativity and learning new things! Being curious keeps the brain healthy. And having that desire to learn allows you to be more open to hearing new ideas and concepts. I'm hoping this pushes me to want to dig into some reading in the future! READ MORE! ALWAYS BE LEARNING!**

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* **The data types in the section include string, boolean, number. A string is a value containing letters or symbols, can be one words or several words, and is wrapped in quotes. A number is either an integer or float, can be positive, negative or 0, and does not have quotes. A boolean is a true/false statement that leads to either a true/false outcome, with no quotes around it.**

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

* **console.log("Hello World!");**

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

* **The characters used to indicate comments are backslashes, and usually two of them I believe! (_Like this: //_) These are usually used to help add information to our code in our spoken language to help other developers decipher the meaning and purpose. Or it can be used to help you by keeping little notes here and there throughout your project!**

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

* **A variable is basically a storage place for data. You can assign a value to a variable and change, manipulate, or use that value whenever you want to! For example, var favoriteFood = "Pizza"; and then we could use this variable by injecting it into a string! For instance, `My favorite food is ${favoriteFood}!` If I wanted to change my favoriteFood then all I would need to do is type out favoriteFood = "Ramen"; and the updated value (Ramen) would now be injected into that string!**

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

* **I use the weather app pretty frequently! Three variables that are likely to be found could be: var weatherTemp (would be an integer), var windSpeed (would be a float), and var dayOfWeek (would be a string).**

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

* **Concatenation is a one way to join things together, and in coding, involves specific symbols to do so. The symbols + + are used around the variable, and the string is surrounded by quotes. This will join the variables in with the rest of string, so they become one. For instance,**
_* var pet = "dog";_
_* var petName = "Arya";_
_console.log("My " + pet + "'s name is " + petName + "!");_

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

* **Thinking back to the weather app, concatenation could probably be used for days of week or time of day, since those change frequently.**

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

* **Would there be a reason to use interpolation over concatenation or the other way around? Or is it a personal preference? What are some examples of concatenation in real world apps or webpages?**
