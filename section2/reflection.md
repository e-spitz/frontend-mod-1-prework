## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

**I tend to ask questions too soon! I'll briefly look for answers (like maybe 5 minutes) and then just shoot the question out to the class. I think I do this because sometimes it can take a while to get an answer and I don't like being at a dead stop in my work due to that! Most of the time I have found out the answer before someone was able to respond to my question, which shows that I could just put a little more time into research before asking the class!**

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

**I kind of expect to have to google things in this course! HAHA! I _did_ ask a classmate how to run the file in node. I was adding too much into the command line. Like instead of *_node function.js_*, I would try *_node prework/function.js_* and it was _not_ working for me! It is frustrating when I don't understand something right away. But that is part of the journey and how I grow as a developer! It's easy to feel stupid when you ask a question and the answer seems so obvious! But everyone has moments like these! This is time for growth!**

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

**A conditional statement is a statement in the if/else or if/then format. For it to be conditional you have to have if and then. They are logic statements that modify how code is executed. "IF it rains today, THEN I won't be going out for a run or walk." In a web application, a password is an if/then statement. *IF* the user can enter the correct password, *THEN* they can access the application.**

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

**To add multiple statements to an IF statement, you can add ELSE and ELSE IF statements. First you begin with an IF condition. If that statement is true, then the code block for that statement will execute. ELSE IF (or if it is not true), is a second condition. If condition one is not true, but condition two IS true, then that code block will execute. If neither IF or ELSE IF conditions are true, another statement ELSE can be executed, which basically  means if anything else is left, then this ELSE code block will be executed.**

 `if (condition1) {
   // if true run this code block for condition 1
 } else if (condition2) {
   // if condition1 is not true and condition2 is true, run this code block
 } else (condition3) {
   //if condition1 and condition2 are not true, then run condition3 code block
 };`

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

**You can always check to see if conditions are met through the terminal by running node and name of file through the command line OR you can check code and conditions through a sandbox, a virtual place online to practice code and run it to see what it produces for you! You could also write out a flow chart of your conditions and make sure it executes how you want it to.**

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

**I feel like I have a pretty good basic understanding of these statements. They are pretty straight forward. If one condition is met, then run this. IF not, then run this. If no conditions are met, then this code should run. It's just an order of questions that asks the computer and then responds based off the answer.**
