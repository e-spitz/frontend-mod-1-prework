## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
**I was out of town visiting family for over a week and I thought I would dedicate more time towards coding, and I didn't! It was a long and exhausting trip, trying to see family and friends. We drove to Kentucky, phew! _SO_ with that being said, I feel a little rushed in finishing the pre-work! =) But I know I can finish it. Just need to stay focused.**
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
**The goals/intentions set were accomplished, however, I do feel like I could do better with the POM breaks. I forget to use the extension on my browser, and my husband was off work so it's easy for me to get distracted talking with him, or playing with our dog, or checking my phone. When I don't have my phone on me I'm definitely more focused. I was able to complete the tasks in under the estimated time, which was reassuring. I work well under pressure I guess! =)**
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
**An object is a way of storing a collection of data, very similar to an array, but more complex. In an array, it stores the information as an _ordered_ list that can be accessed using _only_ index numbers. The data in an object can be accessed using strings, which lets you treat it more like a database of storing and organizing information. You can have an object literal with key-value pairs that store the information.**
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - **Array, numbered/ordered list of students**
  * List of states and their capitals - **Object, collection of data rather than just a single value**
  * List of things to pack for vacation - **Array, stores a list of single values**
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - **Array, just an ordered list of names of accounts**
  * List of student names and their cohort - **Object, since you have to different types of data- names of the students and their specific cohort**
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - **Object, strings and integers for data types so database of information would be better**
  * All my favorite restaurants - **Array, same data type of favorite restaurants with no other information tied to those restaurants.**

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
**Another example of an object could be a weather app. The object would hold different keys such as precipitation, wind speed, temperature, humidity, etc with different values that go along with them.**

/*
var weatherInfo = {
  precipitation: "60%",
  windSpeed: "5mph",
  temperatureInFahrenheit: 65,
  percentHumidity: 23
}
*/
1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
**So far so good I think. Just trying to incorporate them into real world application and coding! But that will come with practice!**
